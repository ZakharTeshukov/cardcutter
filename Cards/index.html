    <p>
        Somaliland has governed itself for three decades but is recognized internationally and by the U.S. as part of Somalia, 
        a position the State Department reaffirmed this week. Unlike the remainder of Somalia and most of its neighbors on the Horn of Africa, 
        though, <span class="highlight">it is democratic and relatively secure</span>. President Bihi noted in our interview that his country 
        would be a <span class="highlight">willing security partner for the U.S.</span> and had recently signed a cooperation agreement 
        with Taiwan. Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) emphasized that <span class="highlight">increasing engagement with Somaliland would counter 
        Chinese and Russian influence</span>.

    <p>
        Somalilandâ€™s government was motivated to establish <span class="highlight">credible, accountable, and representative political institutions</span> 
        due to its lack of external financial assistance. Political actors engaged with the business community, creating a tax-based relationship 
        with citizens. The absence of aid forced <span class="highlight">compromise among opposing political groups</span> and resulted in 
        durable coalition governments.
