       <h3>Warrant 1: Modern ICBMs Discourage Military Escalation</h3>
       <p><span class="author-year">Finnegan Belleau, 2024</span></p>
       <p>Satellite images from last month appeared to show a <span class="highlight">failed test launch of the RS-28 Sarmat missile</span>, raising concerns about Russia’s nuclear arsenal.</p>
       <p>Satellite images taken at the end of September have led arms experts to believe that <span class="highlight">Russia attempted to test its latest intercontinental ballistic missile</span>, the RS-28 Sarmat, but suffered a catastrophic failure.</p>
       <p>The 35-metre-long missile - <span class="highlight">capable of carrying nuclear warheads</span> - has been referred to as <span class="highlight">"Satan II" and "the world’s deadliest weapon,"</span> heightening concerns due to its destructive capabilities.</p>
       <p>"The missile detonated in the silo, leaving a massive crater and destroying the test site," an analyst reported. This could explain the absence of planes supervising test launches, marking the <span class="highlight">fourth known failure of the RS-28.</span></p>
       <p>The RS-28 is designed to replace the RS-20V Voevoda, a missile over 30 years old. Satellite imagery shows <span class="highlight">Russia is proceeding with construction to facilitate the missile's deployment.</span></p>
       <p>Since its unveiling in 2014, <span class="highlight">the RS-28 has faced delays in production and testing</span>. Despite this, <span class="highlight">it is capable of carrying up to 16 nuclear warheads</span> with a range of at least 18,000 km.</p>
       <p>In October 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the RS-28 was ready for deployment, emphasizing its purpose to <span class="highlight">discourage nuclear and military escalation from the United States.</span></p>
       <p>The RS-28 remains central to Russia’s modernization efforts, with deployment underway at several sites despite challenges. <span class="highlight">Putin described the missile as a key element of Russia's strategic deterrent.</span></p>
