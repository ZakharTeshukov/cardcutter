    <div class="card-title">Election Delays Undermine Somaliland’s Stability</div>
    <div> <span class="author-year">Haji Ingiriis, 23</span></div>
    <p class="citation"><em>MLA author-year:</em> Haji Ingiriis, Mohamed. “Somaliland Crisis: Delayed Elections and Armed Conflict Threaten Dream of Statehood.” <em>The Conversation</em>, 22 May 2023, https://theconversation.com/somaliland-crisis-delayed-elections-and-armed-conflict-threaten-dream-of-statehood-200566.</p>
    <p>
        Somaliland’s reputation for stability has suffered due to <span class="highlight">repeated election delays</span> and the accompanying political and social unrest. According to Mohamed Haji Ingiriis, a scholar specializing in Somali society, the postponement of the November 2022 presidential election was accompanied by violent clashes between government forces and clan militias, leading to the deaths of nearly 100 individuals in February 2023.
        <br><br>
        President Muse Bihi Abdi’s administration has been criticized for extending its authority beyond its constitutional term without broad public consent, a move facilitated by traditional clan chiefs. This extension has exacerbated tensions between the dominant Sacad Muuse sub-clan and peripheral clans, who have long felt excluded from power-sharing arrangements. The failure to hold elections on time has <span class="highlight">deepened communal grievances and damaged Somaliland’s democratic credibility</span>.
        <br><br>
        Ingiriis notes that Somaliland’s history of relative peace is now at risk as political and economic grievances accumulate. The ongoing crisis has sparked fears that Somaliland could begin to resemble southern Somalia, marked by instability and armed conflict. Without immediate political reforms and adherence to democratic timelines, Somaliland’s image as a stable democracy may be irrevocably tarnished.

    <p class="citation"><em>MLA author-year:</em> “The Causes and Consequences of Somaliland Presidential Election Delays.” ResearchGate, 2023, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382296293_The_Causes_and_Consequences_of_Somaliland_Presidential_Election_Delays.</p>
    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">COVID-19</span> pandemic has had a profound impact on Somaliland’s election process. The <span></span>COVID-19 pandemic, institutional inefficiencies, and political maneuvering have collectively <span class="highlight">delayed Somaliland’s presidential elections</span>. The National Electoral Commission (NEC) faced logistical and financial challenges that rendered the originally scheduled November 2022 election unfeasible. Additionally, conflicts among NEC members over election laws and budget allocation further hampered progress.
        <br><br>
        The government’s decision to prioritize political party elections over presidential elections drew sharp criticism from opposition parties, sparking protests and clashes. These delays were compounded by controversial term extensions for both the president and the House of Elders, moves that opposition parties condemned as unconstitutional.
        <br><br>
        The delay has not only eroded public trust in Somaliland’s democratic processes but also strained relationships with international partners. Mediation efforts by foreign stakeholders have struggled to bridge the deepening political divides, leaving Somaliland’s democratic trajectory uncertain. The repeated postponements and related controversies have <span class="highlight">exposed systemic weaknesses</span> in Somaliland’s electoral and governance systems.
