    <h1>AT: Somaliland is a stable democracy</h1>
    <h2>RT: Somaliland's democratic stability is undermined by election delays, opposition crackdowns, and economic fragility.</h2>

    <h2><strong>W1:</strong> Election delays and opposition crackdowns undermine Somaliland's democracy.</h2>
    <p class="citation">MLA Citation: Ferragamo, Mariel, and Claire Klobucista. "Somaliland: The Horn of Africa’s Breakaway State." Council on Foreign Relations, 25 Jan. 2024, https://www.cfr.org/somaliland-horn-africa-breakaway-state.</p>
    <p>
        While Somaliland holds democratic elections, <span class="highlight">its government has repeatedly delayed elections</span> and extended the president's term without public consultation. The <span class="highlight">2022 presidential election was postponed</span> and the president's term was extended by two years due to financial challenges, with elections now scheduled for November 2024. Moreover, opposition protests have been <span class="highlight">met with crackdowns</span>, undermining the credibility of the democratic process.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>W2:</strong> Somaliland's democracy is fragile due to its economic challenges and lack of international recognition.</h2>
    <p class="citation">MLA Citation: Ferragamo, Mariel, and Claire Klobucista. "Somaliland: The Horn of Africa’s Breakaway State." Council on Foreign Relations, 25 Jan. 2024, https://www.cfr.org/somaliland-horn-africa-breakaway-state.</p>
    <p>
        Somaliland has a <span class="highlight">GDP of about $2 billion</span>, with most of its economic activity driven by remittances. The economy remains highly fragile with unemployment levels especially high among youth, and it is one of the <span class="highlight">poorest regions in the world</span>. Despite its limited economic resources, Somaliland continues to strive for self-reliance and engages in foreign investments. However, <span class="highlight">without international recognition</span>, the state faces immense barriers to accessing international markets and financial institutions.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>W3:</strong> A stable democracy is not enough for full sovereignty without international recognition.</h2>
    <p class="citation">MLA Citation: Ferragamo, Mariel, and Claire Klobucista. "Somaliland: The Horn of Africa’s Breakaway State." Council on Foreign Relations, 25 Jan. 2024, https://www.cfr.org/somaliland-horn-africa-breakaway-state.</p>
    <p>
        Despite holding democratic elections and having a relatively stable government, Somaliland’s <span class="highlight">lack of international recognition</span> prevents it from achieving full sovereignty. No country formally recognizes its independence, and it remains politically tied to Somalia. <span class="highlight">The African Union (AU) has refused to recognize Somaliland’s independence</span> for fear that it would set a precedent for other secessionist movements in Africa. As a result, Somaliland’s governance, while relatively stable, does not meet the full criteria for statehood without broader recognition.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>W4:</strong> Somaliland's democratic progress is further limited by its geopolitical context and security concerns.</h2>
    <p class="citation">MLA Citation: Ferragamo, Mariel, and Claire Klobucista. "Somaliland: The Horn of Africa’s Breakaway State." Council on Foreign Relations, 25 Jan. 2024, https://www.cfr.org/somaliland-horn-africa-breakaway-state.</p>
    <p>
        The Horn of Africa faces significant instability due to conflicts, including the ongoing insurgency by al-Shabaab in Somalia. <span class="highlight">Somaliland's geographical location makes it vulnerable</span> to these regional security issues, and its pursuit of foreign investment in ports like Berbera has raised tensions with Somalia. Furthermore, Somaliland's lack of a formal relationship with international financial institutions exacerbates its vulnerability in the face of <span class="highlight">regional insecurity and economic pressures</span>.
